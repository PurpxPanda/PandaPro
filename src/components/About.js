Hi, I'm John Xavier Ray, a passionate and dedicated Full Stack Web Developer based in Bethpage, TN. I recently graduated from Vanderbilt University with a certificate in full stack web development, adding to my high school diploma from Mcgavock High School in Nashville, TN.

I'm a fresh graduate of a bootcamp program, eager to kickstart my career in web development. I have honed my skills in a variety of programming languages and technologies, including CSS, JavaScript, HTML, React, JSON, MongoDB, JWT, Git, SQL, and Node. These tools allow me to build dynamic and engaging websites that deliver an exceptional user experience.

During my bootcamp journey, I had the opportunity to work on various projects that showcased my capabilities. Notably, I developed a fully functional E-Commerce site called HydroHomies and a blog-style website called SharedLunch. These projects reflect my ability to conceptualize and bring innovative web solutions to life.

While I am skilled in full stack development, my true passion lies in web design. I have a strong desire to expand my knowledge of component libraries and become a proficient web designer. I possess a keen eye for aesthetics and aim to blend my technical expertise with creative design principles, ultimately delivering visually appealing and intuitive web experiences.

My ultimate goal is to become a Full Stack Web Developer specializing in web design, while also maintaining a well-rounded skill set across all aspects of the business. I am excited to collaborate on exciting projects and contribute my expertise to help businesses thrive. Continuous learning is crucial to me, and I stay updated with the latest industry trends and advancements.

Let's create exceptional web experiences together!
